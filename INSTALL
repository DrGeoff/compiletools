A variety of installation methods are possible.  

1) git clone from github and run from repository
2) pip install (as either user, root or virtualenv)
3) build an RPM
4) build a deb (currently unimplemented)


1) clone the github repository

git clone git://github.com/Zomojo/compiletools

Add the compiletools directory to your PATH
export PATH=$PATH:path_to_compiletools_repo


2a) pip install as user
On Ubuntu 16.04

pip install --user compiletools

will install into "~/.local/"  so you need to have "~/.local/bin" in your path to pick up the executables.


On Ubuntu 17.04:

pip install compiletools

will install into "~/.local/"  so you need to have "~/.local/bin" in your path to pick up the executables.


2b) pip install as root
On Ubuntu 16.04

sudo pip install compiletools

will install into /usr/local.  By default /usr/local/bin is in your path so no extra work is required.


On Ubuntu 17.04:

sudo -H pip install compiletools

will install into /usr/local.  By default /usr/local/bin is in your path so no extra work is required.


3) Build an RPM (these instructions were tested on Fedora 26)
Make sure you have the building tools installed

sudo dnf install python2-docutils rpm-build

Then download a tarball and turn it into the RPM

rpmhome=$(rpm --eval %_topdir)
pushd "$rpmhome"
tag="v4.1.43"
tarball=${tag}.tar.gz
curl -L "https://github.com/Zomojo/compiletools/archive/${tarball}" -o "SOURCES/${tarball}"
rpmbuild -tb "SOURCES/${tarball}"
popd
dnf install ${rpmhome}/RPMS/noarch/python-compiletools-4.1.43-1.fc26.noarch.rpm
